**READ ME**

This is just a simple read me.

Most of the tasks require input, but since I used NodeJS, 
I used function parameter as a sample of accepting inputs from 
user, so it would not be a hassle.

There are two parts in the technical exam which are the `Programming Challenges` and `Integration Task`, therefore, inside the `src` folder
you will find two corresponding directories.

`Running Programming Challenges`

- Uncomment the task you would like to run and run the command below.
```
npm run start:pc
```

`Running Integration Task`
- To start integration-task, run the command below.
```
npm run start:ic
```
